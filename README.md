## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd github-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your GitHub token (optional, but recommended to avoid rate limits):
   ```
   VITE_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
   ```
   
   You can generate a personal access token at [GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens). The token only needs public access permissions.

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

Build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The build artifacts will be in the `dist` directory.

### Deployment

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
# or
yarn preview
```

Deploy to your favorite hosting platform:
- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- Any static hosting provider

## Usage

1. **Single User View**: Enter a GitHub username to view their statistics
2. **Compare Mode**: Toggle "Compare Mode" to add multiple users and compare their metrics
3. **Authentication**: Add your GitHub token using the button in the top-right corner to increase API rate limits and see private contribution activity

## API Rate Limits

GitHub API has rate limits:
- **Unauthenticated**: 60 requests per hour
- **Authenticated**: 5,000 requests per hour

The dashboard implements several strategies to handle these limits:
- Smart caching of API responses
- Token-based authentication 
- Warning messages when approaching limits
- Graceful degradation when limits are reached

## Privacy & Security

- Your GitHub token is stored only in your browser's local storage
- No data is sent to any server other than GitHub's APIs
- Environment variables containing tokens are excluded from version control
